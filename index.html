        <h2>Welcome to My Portfolio</h2>
        <p>
          Welcome to my portfolio where I showcase my journey as a web
          developer. Here, you can explore my projects, learn about my
          experience, and see how my passion for front-end development has
          shaped my work. Whether it's creating responsive websites or enhancing
          user experience, I am always eager to push the boundaries of web
          development.
        </p>

        <h3>What You'll Find Here</h3>
        <p>
          On this website, you’ll find a detailed overview of the projects I’ve
          worked on, my skills and experience, and a bit more about who I am as
          a developer.
        </p>

        <h3>Stay Tuned for Updates</h3>
        <p>
          This site is a work in progress, with more visuals, animations, and
          enhancements coming soon. As I continue to develop my skills and
