        <p></p>

        <h3>My Passion</h3>
        <p>
          I have a deep interest in front-end development, where creativity and
          technical skills come together to create great user experiences. My
          goal is to either become a full-time website developer or a front-end
          engineer, where I can build dynamic and responsive websites that make
          an impact.
        </p>

        <h3>What Drives Me</h3>
        <p>
          As someone who loves design and problem-solving, I enjoy creating
          websites from scratch and working on user interfaces that are easy to
          navigate. I’m constantly learning new front-end technologies like
          React, CSS frameworks, and responsive design techniques to improve my
          skills.
        </p>

        <h3>Looking Ahead</h3>
        <p>
          My goal for the future is to dive deeper into front-end engineering
          while continuing to expand my knowledge in full-stack development. I’m
          eager to work in collaborative environments where I can grow as a
          developer and contribute to impactful projects.
